# Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data

## Domain
Data Science

## Task Number
Task 5

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts product sales based on advertising expenditure on TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- TV: Advertising budget spent on TV
- Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio
- Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspaper
- Sales: Total sales generated

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries
2. Loaded the advertising dataset
3. Separated independent and dependent variables
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained the model using Multiple Linear Regression
6. Evaluated model performance using visualization
7. Predicted sales for new input data

## Model Used
Multiple Linear Regression

## Output
- Scatter plot of Actual Sales vs Predicted Sales
- Predicted sales for new advertising data:
  - TV = 150
  - Radio = 25
  - Newspaper = 20
- Predicted Sales ≈ 14.47

## Result
The model shows a strong correlation between actual and predicted sales, indicating good performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Multiple Linear Regression can be used to predict sales effectively based on advertising data.
